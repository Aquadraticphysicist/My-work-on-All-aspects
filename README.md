# My-work-on-All-aspects
I am interested in cosmology,the fundamental structures of the universe(especially quantum gravity) and the key applications of Science(Mostly concerned about space travelling.).
I will share all my published and well acknowledged thoughts here, meanwhile I will still be maintaining a discussion session to discuss and ask questions.
Here is the list of my work(being updated continuously every time new things come out):
1.A total analytical system to help analyse and integrate all the data and situations of GW(gravitatonal wave) detectors and the results(being built).
2.Some strange but theoretically executable works.
3.Discussions on GW and QG(quantum gravity) effect detectors.(mainly concerning on how to improve the accuracy and stablity and executing difficulties. Needing help from other scientists to help analyse things.)
